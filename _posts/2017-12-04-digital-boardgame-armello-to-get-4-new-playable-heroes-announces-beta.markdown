# It's a Super Mutant Quadrupedal Battle Royale! 

Australia-based studio [League of Geeks](http://leagueofgeeks.com/) announced on Twitter today that four new heroes would be joining the roster of playable characters in their online digital boardgame, Armello. 

 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Four new Heroes are approaching Armello, and we would like to graciously invite you to greet them.<br><br>From the December 12th - 13th (PT), the Rivals Beta Event will be live on Steam and you can try them for free.<br><br>More info - <a href="https://t.co/DHVTzCkvQS">https://t.co/DHVTzCkvQS</a> <a href="https://t.co/XLZOHNHe4V">pic.twitter.com/XLZOHNHe4V</a></p>&mdash; Armello (@ArmelloGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArmelloGame/status/937847835533369345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

Adding to the excitement of the announcement is the mention of a beta period where the new heroes will be available to everyone for free beginning December 11th at 3:00 PM PST and ending December 13th also at 3:00 PM PST. This is an extremely generous move considering the ultimate outcome is for these heroes to be paid downloadable content however the 48 hour window is in the middle of the week. It may prove difficult for those with tight work schedules to be able to set aside time for it, though having a free trial period at all is still gracious.

Mixing tabletop RPG questing with card playing and dice rolling mechanics amidst gorgeously animated visuals Don Bluth would be proud of, Armello has been one of my personal favorite go-to multiplayer games since it originally launched in September of 2015. 

The game didn't set the world on fire but since its release it's developed an ***extremely*** consistent and passionate player base who jump at every available update. The amount of support the game has received over the last two years is impressive and so I, along with everyone else in the community, anxiously await the reveal of the next posse of woodland critters with whom we will engage in glorious combat.

Armello is available on Steam, Xbox One, PS4, Mac, Linux and, if you're currently residing in Australia, your mobile phone which is [blowing my mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1PQ8rCYZNM) right now. 

**UPDATE 12/6/2017 : **League of Geeks have begun to slowly unveil images of the new heroes coming to the game starting with Hargrave, Thunder Earl. 

His look alone makes him my favorite member of the game's rabbit clan. His weapon appears to be a pole-arm mounted cannon and I absolutely cannot wait to see how he attacks in battle.
