## More Than Just a Sidekick

Some of the most memorable faces in gaming aren't necessarily those controlled by the player. Supporting characters like *Bioshock Infinite*'s interdimensional traveler Elizabeth or *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*'s relentlessly bothersome fairy Navi are examples of those who have cemented their place within the annals of gaming's history. Characters like these succeed at eliciting an emotional response from the player in ways that go above and beyond their roles on paper. 

To be so evocative so as to be remembered for years to come can be the result of who they were or what their relevance was to how their game played. When the topic of indelible supporting characters arises I always lean towards Elizabeth, wonderfully brought to life by actress Courtnee Draper. Elizabeth is an example of of the former, of a character I remember because of who they were. The combination of Ms. Draper's performance and impressive motion capture was strong enough to reserve a special spot in my memory and has held it ever since I finished the game in 2013.
