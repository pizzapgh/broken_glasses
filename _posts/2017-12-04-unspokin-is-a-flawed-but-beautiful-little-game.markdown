# 5Horsemen Studios' Short Tale Illustrates the Delicate Balance Between Man and Nature

## More Than Just a Sidekick

Some of the most memorable faces in gaming aren't necessarily those controlled by the player. Supporting characters like *Bioshock Infinite*'s interdimensional traveler Elizabeth or *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*'s relentlessly bothersome fairy Navi are examples of those who have cemented their place within the annals of gaming's history. Characters like these succeed at eliciting an emotional response from the player in ways that go above and beyond their roles on paper. 

To be so evocative so as to be remembered for years to come can be the result of who they were or what their relevance was to how their game played. When the topic of indelible supporting characters arises I always lean towards Elizabeth, wonderfully brought to life by actress Courtnee Draper. Elizabeth is an example of of the former, of a character I remember because of who they were. The combination of Ms. Draper's performance and impressive motion capture was strong enough to reserve a special spot in my memory and has held it ever since I finished the game in 2013.

Navi on the other hand is a character who lives on not only due to her overeager and oft annoying curiosity, but to her impact on game play. Z-targeting revolutionized the way developers approach real time 3D melee combat and its association with Navi ensured her place within the hearts and minds of gamers everwhere. We remember to listen because she taught us to kick ass. 

Elizabeth and Navi are examples of partnerships with the player that just worked, absolutely nailing the most important aspect of their roles which is to be a benefit not a detriment. Their success in this could rest on something as major as providing integral plot points or as seemingly minor as just being a friend in a lonely world. 

The best partnerships however, are the ones where one cannot go on without the other.
