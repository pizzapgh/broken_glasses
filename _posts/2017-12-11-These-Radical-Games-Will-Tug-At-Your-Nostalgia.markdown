# Where's the Beef? 

I've noticed something lately in entertainment and that's 80's nostalgia seems to be gaining popularity in a big way. Everywhere I look there's something new that capitalizes on the iconic retrowave aesthetic that permeated those years or on capturing those feelings of science fiction mystery and adventure Ã  la *The Goonies*, *Stand by Me* or the *Back to the Future* trilogy. Hollywood's produced successful films such as the remake of *It*, *Blade Runner 2049* and *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. On the small screen who could forget the breakout Netflix hit *Stranger Things* and lesser known *Dark* (which I'll talk about soon on this site). 

What's funny about the 80s is that if it were a feature film, then over the course of nearly 30 years that film has developed a worldwide cult following despite initially receiving malign criticism (mostly for a poor soundtrack). For the gaming industry in particular it was a very important decade as it was in 1985 that the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America and single handedly revived the market after the crash of '83.  

As a result an older generation of gamers now have a soft spot for many a franchise that saw its rise to popularity begin in that era, but newer gamers can still appreciate when developers draw their inspiration from it.
