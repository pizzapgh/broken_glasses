# Where's the Beef? 

I've noticed something lately in entertainment and that's 80's nostalgia seems to be gaining stride in a big way. Everywhere I look there's something new that capitalizes on the iconic retrowave aesthetic that permeated those years or on capturing those feelings of science fiction mystery and adventure Ã  la *The Goonies*, *Stand by Me* or the *Back to the Future* trilogy. Hollywood's produced successful films such as the remake of *It*, *Blade Runner 2049* and *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. On the small screen who could forget the breakout Netflix hit *Stranger Things* and lesser known *Dark* (which I'll talk about soon on this site). 

What's funny about the 80s is that if it were a feature film, then over the course of nearly 30 years that film has developed a worldwide cult following despite initially receiving malign criticism (mostly for a poor soundtrack). Speaking for the gaming industry in particular it was a very important decade as it was in 1985 that the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America and single handedly revived the market after the video game crash of '83.  

Indie developers have recognized the growing wave of nostalgia spreading across all of entertainment and today I've put together a list of titles currently in development that will appeal to those who wish to ride it. If you're into retro or synthwave, neo-noir, teen comedies, science fiction or cyber punk then there's likely something here for you.
