# Where's the Beef? 

I've noticed something lately in the indie gaming scene: 80's nostalgia seems to be gaining popularity in a big way. Everywhere I look there's a new title that capitalizes on synthwave, retrowave, or on capturing the shared feelings of mystery and adventure amongst best friends Ã  la *The Goonies*, *Stand by Me* or *It*. It's not just in games either. Hollywood has spent time producing successful films such as the remake of *It*, *Blade Runner 2049* and *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. Of course who could forget the breakout Netflix hit *Stranger Things* and lesser known *Dark* (which I'll talk about soon on this site). 

What's funny about the 80s is that if it were a feature film, then over the course of nearly 30 years that film has developed a worldwide cult following despite initially receiving malign criticism (mostly for a poor soundtrack). For the gaming industry in particular it was a very important decade as it was in 1985 that the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America and single handedly revived the market after the crash of '83.  

For nerds of the gaming and science fiction variety, the 80's represent a decade of exciting technological advancements and debut franchises
