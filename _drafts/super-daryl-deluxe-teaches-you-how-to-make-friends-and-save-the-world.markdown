# Dan and Gary Games' Hand Drawn Action RPG Nods to Classic Teenage Satire

This article is an edited transcript of an earlier [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkOPysxAm74) originally published on 4/5/17

## The Winning Losers

If the super hero genre has been Hollywood's darling throughout the twenty-tens, then the eighties belonged to the teen comedy. Hollywood produced dozens of films painting a theatrical portrait of what life was like for the  average teenager in High School, commonly satirizing the institution as a dull prison for the eager imaginations of its prisoners. The common "click" was established and stories of jocks, emos, cool kids, middle of the roaders and yes, nerds were all told.  

Highschool was the common theme for a reason. It was a period when our imaginations were rife with thoughts of being someone else; someone better than ourselves. We daydreamed and our dreams took us outside those classroom walls to someplace where we made a difference. Or I suppose what was more likely at the time, someplace anywhere else. These sentiments provided the foundation for the characters in films we love today such as *The Breakfast Club*, *Ferris Bueler's Day Off*, *Risky Business* or *Teen Wolf*. 

Recently I looked at a title that puts the player in the shoes of an awkward teenager who, perhaps unwittingly, acts to save everyone from the schemes of a group bent on global dominion. He'll do so with a bit of anti-social charisma and the willingness to indulge in his imagination and become someone better: a hero.
