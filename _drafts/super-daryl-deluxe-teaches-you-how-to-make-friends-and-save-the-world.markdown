# Dan and Gary Games' Hand Drawn Action RPG Nods to Classic Teenage Satire

This article is an edited transcript of an earlier [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkOPysxAm74) originally published on 4/5/17

## The Winning Losers

If the super hero genre has been Hollywood's darling throughout the twenty-tens, then the eighties belonged to the teen comedy. During those years Hollywood produced dozens of films painting a theatrical portrait of what life was like for the  average teenager in High School, commonly satirizing the institution as a dull prison for the eager imaginations of its prisoners. The common "click" was established and stories of jocks, emos, cool kids, middle of the roaders and yes, nerds were all told.  

Highschool was the common theme for a reason. It was a period when our imaginations were rife with thoughts of being someone else; someone better than ourselves. We daydreamed and our dreams took us outside those classroom walls to someplace where we made a difference. Or I suppose what was more likely at the time, someplace anywhere else. These sentiments provided the foundation for the characters in films we love today such as *The Breakfast Club*, *Ferris Bueler's Day Off*, *Teen Wolf* or *Weird Science*. 

Recently I looked at a title that puts the player in the shoes of an awkward teenager who, perhaps unwittingly, acts to save everyone from the schemes of a group bent on global dominion. He'll do so with a bit of anti-social charisma and the willingness to indulge in his imagination and become someone better: a hero.

## Fast Times at Water Falls High

Super Daryl Deluxe is a 2D RPG brawler that tells its story from the perspective of the titular Daryl, an awkward teenager just looking to make friends. The social anxieties that come from being the new kid at school serve as the framework for Daryl's misadventurous attempts to impress his classmates which eventually lead to his involvement in a larger plot of mind control and world domination. With a combat system boasting dozens of skills and passive abilities, you'll slug your way through portals to alternate dimensions, time travel and meet with historical figures and occasionally engage in mono e mono bouts with school personnel. 

The game begins with a bit of exposition, detailing the 1975 graduation of two students from Water Falls High School: Eli Bavarious and Kent Hangarman. As valedictorian and salutatorian respectively, the two boys leave with high honors and come up with a plan to write self help books that will benefit the world and define their legacy.

 

Forty years later Kent Hangarman is now principal and Daryl Whitelaw arrives as a new student. He is introduced by Vice Principal Mr. Robatto to students Paul and Alan who, after a somewhat uncomfortable introduction, decide that Daryl's unique propensity for making friends  (or not, rather) makes him a perfect fit as product manager for their Textbook Emporium. It sounds official, but really all they do is steal textbooks and then resell them to the students. The textbook market however has already been cornered by a group of students known as the Trenchcoat Kids who will collectively act as your go-to shop for items in the game but more on that later. 

The build I was sent only contained the first two chapters of the eventual six so the overall narrative didn't progress much further than the occasional bit of foreshadowing but it's clear that Principal Hangarman is up to something and is now using his old Alma Mater as a platform from which to launch the beginning phases of his scheme.
